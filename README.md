# Linked List/Runtime Polymorphism
 This project represents the peak of my knowledege in C++, employing pointers, classes, templating and runtime polymorphism in the same project. It takes in a file containing a sequenced list of triangles, and draws them in 2D space using the SFML infrastructure
The makefile provided with this repository can be used to quickly compile it.
