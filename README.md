# Linked List/Runtime Polymorphism
 This project represents the peak of my knowledege in C++, employing pointers, classes, templating and runtime polymorphism in the same project. It takes in a file containing a sequenced list of triangles, and draws them in 2D space using the SFML infrastructure. The program categorizes the triangles into three types: scalene, right and isoceles, all of which originate from the same template and can therefore be stored in the same linked list object
 
 This program also contains a linked list .hpp file coded by myself, templated to handle any object type stored within itself and with optimized search algorithms associated with it
The makefile provided with this repository can be used to quickly compile it.
